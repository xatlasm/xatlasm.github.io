Wouldn't it be great if you could get all of your favorite sites
delivered to you automatically, like a magazine? You wouldn't have to
keep checking them throughout the day for updates, so you could use that
time for other purposes. And if you hate internet ads as much as I do (a
lot!), what if I told you that you could easily avoid them as well?

Well, luckily for you, I'm about to!

What is RSS?
------------

RSS (Rich Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication) is a very common
(though not widely known by many people) technology that collects the
content from a web site (blogs, news headlines, YouTube videos, etc.)
and delivers them to you using software called a feed reader.
Personally, I have been regularly using RSS since 2007 and it has been
one of my favorite productivity secrets for using the Internet.

Why use RSS?
------------

By using RSS, you will no longer have to visit every single website that
you regularly read every time that you want to check for new content.
Instead, new content from all of your sites will be delivered to your
feed reader so that you can read all of your sites in one place, like a
personalized magazine.

Sounds good! Where do I sign up?
--------------------------------

The *de facto* leader in RSS used to be the excellent Google Reader, but
with Google's decision to [kill
it](http://googleblog.blogspot.com.au/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html)
last year, a company called Feedly has moved to the forefront. I
recommend Feedly for its ease of use and wide compatibility with other
RSS services (like smartphone apps).

To start, [visit Feedly](https://feedly.com/index.html#welcome) and sign
up using your Google account. If you don't already have a Google account
(unlikely), I suggest that you get one because they are extremely useful
around the Internet.

How do I add sites to Feedly?
-----------------------------

In Feedly, click the "Add Content" button in the upper-left part of the
window.

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/images/feedly-add-content.png){:height="400px"}

Then, in the search box, search for the site you are interested in, or
type/paste a URL directly if you already know which site you want to
read. You can also browse Feedly's site collection if you are looking
for something new.

You mentioned smartphone apps. Tell me more.
--------------------------------------------

You can access your Feedly subscriptions using your smartphone, letting
you read all of your sites from anywhere. Feedly has their own official
apps for iOS and Android which you can use:

[Feedly for
Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devhd.feedly)

[Feedly for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/feedly/id396069556)

Conclusion
----------

Using RSS will save you a lot of time and needless clicking around on
the Internet just to read the sites that you love. Instead, you will be
able to speed-read your content in minutes, often without ads. You can
also have your favorite YouTube channels delivered to you automatically
along with all your other content. This way, you will waste less time
getting to the content you want and more time enjoying it!
