Economist by training, data scientist by trade, living in Durham, NC and working in San Jose, CA. Like everyone else, I am on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghuiber) too.

### Eno River

The Eno flows through Durham and it's pretty. Though you should definitely hike in the [park](http://www.ncparks.gov/Visit/parks/enri/main.php) and give some money to the [conservancy](http://www.enoriver.org), this blog has nothing to do with either.

Back in 2007, freshly laid off, I started doing freelance statistical work. That paid the bills until 2010. I called my shop Eno River Analytics and I claimed this domain because it was available.

I could have picked a better name. I speak with an accent. When I say "Eno River Analytics" people tend to hear "in a river analytics" and are rightly confused.
