## About me

I am a nuclear engineer by trade, but I have many other interests, including (but not limited to):

* Japan
* Japanese language
* Travel
* Cooking
* Baking
* Technology
* Gadgets
* Web design
* Android
* Linux
* Podcasts
* Youtube

...and other things that I can't think of at the moment. 

## About this site

This site runs on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a popular static site generator. It uses the [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) theme, which I have modified using bits and pieces from [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/) (by [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark)), [Gabi Huiber](https://github.com/ghuiber), and [Anand Mani Sankar](https://github.com/msanand).

The source code for this site can be found at my [Github repository](http://github.com/xatlasm/xatlasm.github.io). Feel free to fork the code and modify it yourself!
